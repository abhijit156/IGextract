,Statement
0,each podling in incubation must report to the incubator pmc.
1,"podlings shall report monthly for their first three months, after that quarterly."
2,"the incubator pmc may, at their discretion, ask a podlings to report more frequently."
3,"the ppmc with the mentor(s) help, must produce a report for the incubator pmc detailing overall progress toward graduation and any issues the podling has encountered."
4,there are restrictions on where podlings can host their websites and what branding they can use on them.
5,there are restrictions about how podlings can use their own and other asf brands and names.
6,"there are some restrictions about how podlings can advertise themselves, especially in press releases related to podlings."
7,"podling web sites must include a clear disclaimer on their website and in all documentation, releases and release announcements stating that they are in incubation."
8,a podling has a choice of two disclaimers: a standard disclaimer or a work-in-progress disclaimer.
9,podlings wishing to use a different disclaimer message must have the incubator pmc approve it before use.
10,podlings wanting to follow all asf policy on releases should use the following text for all disclaimers (replace the underlined text as appropriate):
11,"apache podling-name is an effort undergoing incubation at the apache software foundation (asf), sponsored by the name of apache tlp sponsor ."
12,"incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful asf projects."
13,"while incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the asf."
14,"for releases, the text should be included in a separate disclaimer file stored alongside the notice and license files."
15,podling wishing to make releases that may not follow all asf policy should use the following disclaimer (replace the underlined text where needed):
16,"apache podling-name is an effort undergoing incubation at the apache software foundation (asf), sponsored by the name of apache tlp sponsor ."
17,"incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision-making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful asf projects."
18,"while incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the asf."
19,some of the incubating project's releases may not be fully compliant with asf policy.
20,"for example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing conditions."
21,what follows is a list of issues the project is currently aware of (this list is likely to be incomplete):
22,list of known issues goes here
23,"if you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine the overall implications of including this work."
24,"for the current status of this project through the apache incubator, visit: https://incubator.apache.org/projects/ apache podling-name .html"
25,"for releases, the text should be included in a separate disclaimer-wip file stored alongside the notice and license files."
26,the podling can make non-asf releases while incubating as long as it is moving towards making asf releases.
27,podlings must not perform any asf releases of software without the approval of the incubator pmc.
28,"when a podling decides it wants to make an asf release, the podling must hold a vote on their public dev list."
29,at least three +1 votes are required (see the apache voting process page) and more +1 votes than -1 votes.
30,"if the vote passes, the podling must send a summary of that vote to the incubator's general list and request that the incubator pmc approve the release."
31,three +1 incubator pmc votes are required to approve a release.
32,"should the incubator pmc vote to approve a release, the podling may make that release available to the public under these conditions:"
33,"the release archive(s) must include the word ""incubating"" in the filename."
34,"the release archive(s) must contain a disclaimer (see above), which should be placed in a disclaimer or disclaimer-wip file."
35,releases for the podling must be distributed through http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/ podling. 
36,the podling may choose to distribute approved releases through other channels by following the guidelines here .
37,"after voting someone into the ppmc on the ppmc private list, the podling must send a notice email to the private@incubator list."
38,the ppmc must wait for 72 hours before inviting the new ppmc member to join the ppmc.
39,"as with all pmcs, new the ipmc votes on proposed members on the private@incubator list."
40,"after a vote has finished, the ipmc must send a notice email to the board"
41,and then wait for 72 hours before inviting the proposed member.
42,"any asf member can ask to be an ipmc member, without a vote, but the ipmc must still give notice to the board."
43,the incubator pmc should notify a podling of any policy violations.
44,it may consider termination of a podling that does not correct such violations.
45,a major criterion for podling graduation to top level project (tlp) status is to have developed an open and diverse meritocratic community.
46,"as a project grows, it needs to renew itself by accepting new committers."
47,a project needs to learn how it can recruit new developers and committers into the community.
48,the openness of the community is not only measured by the number of contributors.
49,open and respectful discussions on the mailing lists are vital.
50,community members must learn ways to resolve technical conflicts without destroying personal relationships.
51,email lists are the lifeblood of apache communities. they are the primary mode of discourse and constitute a public and historical record of the project.
52,"other forms of communication (p2p, f2f, personal emails, instant messaging platform posts, and so on) are secondary."
53,"if a project uses alternative forms of communication, it is essential to try to minimize the chances of problems arising."
54,all matters of substance need to move back to the email lists.
55,"projects need to preserve, and post back to the lists, significatn conversation threads in other channels."
56,project should post regular reminders that other secondary forms of communication exist.
57,"there is a limited number of topics, such as security issues and discussions about people, which it is best to handl in private."
58,"as much business of the project as possible should take place on public lists, but the private list is available for matters of a sensitive nature."
59,good netiquette requires that you seek permission from the poster before making public posts made to a private list.
60,"before a podling graduates, it must create a diverse and self-sustaining community."
61,"to address this challenge, committers may need to devote more time to community-building and less to development."
62,"if the podling's software has lots of users but very few new developers, the community needs to do more work to encourage users to become developers."
63,"however, once a project gains momentum, it may be more productive for the long-term health of a project to encourage users to propose solutions to non-critical problems and, thus, become more involved."
64,try to encourage expert users to answer questions.
65,try to encourage users to become developers.
66,"when they give a good answer that the documentation doesn't cover, ask them to submit a patch."
67,"when users suggest a good design or extension, ask for volunteers to help implement it rather than just coding it up."
68,"to become an apache committer, a developer needs to hang around long enough to accumulate a track record of contributions."
69,it may also be that the committer bar is set too high.
70,promptly reviewing patches or pull requests is essential.
71,provide credit in the commit message and when closing the issue.
72,it's also good to encourage developers by suggesting new related work they may like to volunteer to work on.
73,each podling project management committee (ppmc) helps its podling learn how to govern itself.
74,"initially, it is composed of the podling's mentors and the initial committers."
75,"the ppmc is directly responsible for the oversight of the podling, and it also decides who to add as a ppmc member."
76,a private email list named private@ project lets the ppmc discuss confidential topics.
77,most communication should be on the podling's dev list!
78,"the private list is only for confidential discussions that should not be made public, such as the suitability of a particular individual to become a committer or a member of the ppmc."
79,the mentors should verify that all ppmc members are subscribed to the private list.
80,"each member of the ppmc should be on the dev list, so posting to dev is sufficient."
81,"each member of the incubator pmc is on the incubator general list, so posting to the general list is sufficient."
82,"on a monthly basis, the ipmc collects reports from each incubating project and sends them to the asf board."
83,watch the incubator general email list for when these become due.
84,the incubator report includes the status of a subset of the incubating projects.
85,"currently, new podlings report to the incubator monthly for the first three months, then quarterly after that."
86,the ppmc does not have to fill out the report itself; the ppmc is just responsible for making sure that it gets filled out.
87,it is better to discuss the report on the dev list and ask everyone to contribute to it.
88,"if mentors disagree with the posted report, they should say so; otherwise, the incubator pmc assumes that the report speaks for the community."
89,mentors must sign off on podling reports.
90,"- if there is no mentor sign off, the ipmc will not accept the report from that podling; it will have to submit a new report in the following month."
91,add your podling reports to the incubator wiki:
92,- add each podling report to the incubator wiki
93,"- follow the instructions in your report reminder, and post on the month year page, with the provided template"
94,"in addition to the quarterly status reports, each podling has a page on the incubator web site that tracks its status (see the complete list for examples)."
95,maintain your podling roster in whimsy podling roster .
96,"adding committers is one of the most important functions of any pmc, including incubator podlings."
97,there are no asf-wide rules on how to decide when to invite someone to become a committer. experience shows that it's best to keep the bar low.
98,"most projects use formal [discuss] and [vote] threads on the private email list, and others use a more ""lazy"" consensus approach."
99,the podling incubator reports should document any committers added since the previous report.
100,"if the podling decides in favor of the potential committer, it offers committership to the nominee."
101,"if the nominee accepts the responsibility of being a committer for the project, the nominee formally becomes an apache committer."
102,the proposer then asks an ipmc member (typically one of the mentors) to follow the documented procedures to complete the process.
103,"if the nominee is already an apache committer on another project, the ipmc member can add the nominee as a committer on the podling via the whimsy podling roster ."
104,"the proposer then directs the new committer to the apache developer's pages , to the apache incubator site and to the incubator committers guide for important additional information."
105,it should be a goal of a podling to have all committers participate in the ppmc.
106,the ppmc should take an active role in watching committers develop as community participants.
107,"they should identify those who are participating at a community level (not just a technical one), and approach them with an offer of ppmc membership."
108,any member of the ppmc can propose a new member of the ppmc.
109,"the proposal should be discussed in private on the ppmc's private email list, with a subject line of ""[discuss] joe bob ppmc membership""."
110,"if there is consensus that the proposed member is suitable, there should be a formal vote with the subject line of ""[vote] joe bob ppmc membership"" on the ppmc's private email list."
111,"if the vote is successful, a member of the ppmc sends a message to the ppmc private email list, with the subject line of ""[vote][result] joe bob ppmc membership""."
112,the nominating ppmc member should send a message to the ipmc ( private@incubator.apache.org ) with a reference to the vote result in the following form:
113,to: private at incubator.apache.org
114,cc: private at podling.incubator.apache.org
115,subject: [notice] joe bob for podling ppmc
116,body:
117,joe bob has been voted as a new member of the *podling* ppmc. the vote thread is at: *link to the vote thread*
118,note that there is a grace period of 72 hours from when the ppmc sends the notice to the ipmc to when the ppmc should formally invite the proposed member.
119,this is an important part of the overall process.
120,failure to do this can result in an embarassing situation for people involved.
121,"in the email you send, replace podling with your podling's actual name, and replace joe bob with the person's actual name."
122,"after 72 hours, the ppmc should invite joe bob to join it, using message like this ."
123,"once the proposed member has accepted, a moderator for the ppmc mail list accepts the new member's subscription request."
124,a mentor must be an ipmc member.
125,people who are not ipmc members can still help out in an informal capacity.
126,ipmc members are free to volunteer to mentor a podling.
127,"to do so, they should mail the podling stating their intentions."
128,the podling should then decide whether it wants to add the mentor.
129,"if the podling decides to add the mentor, it should do so in the whimsy podling roster ."
130,"if a podling is in a position where they feel they need a new mentor, they can drop an email on the general incubator email list to try to recruit a one."
131,after discussing it with the ppmc you can have someone with access (another mentor) remove the mentor via whimsy.
132,the only time when a ppmc member's vote is binding is for the addition of new ppmc members and committers.
133,release votes are only binding for ipmc members.
134,"donating your project to the asf means giving up control of it, and its trademarks if any."
135,"to give our ""podlings"" (incubating projects) the best chances of success, we usually ask them to enter the incubator with at least the start of a community built around an existing codebase."
136,"to achieve this, an incoming project (""podling"") goes through the following steps:"
137,find a champion and incubation mentors and discuss and prepare an incubation proposal
138,decide to incubate at the asf
139,discuss the proposal with the incubator pmc
140,"if needed, refine the list of initial committers and mentors in the proposal"
141,"if needed, refine the proposal based on incubator pmc feedback"
142,let the incubator pmc vote on the proposal
143,set up the podling's infrastructure
144,start building a community around the podling's code
145,invite new committers and ppmc members
146,make podling releases and document and refine both the code and the release process
147,"when you feel ready to graduate, assess the podling's readiness with the incubation mentors"
148,"if applicable, prepare the transfer of existing trademarks to the asf"
149,discuss graduation with the incubator pmc
150,"start the graduation vote with the incubator pmc, leading to an asf board resolution to establish the tlp"
151,to communicate with the incubator pmc use the public link:+https://lists.apache.org/list.html?
152,"to enter the incubator, your project needs a champion and at least two or three mentors ."
153,"these people need to be part of the incubator pmc, which asf members can join just by asking."
154,"the champion helps the incoming podling in the process of creating their proposal and acts as a liaison between the podling and the incubator pmc for the initial steps, at least until the podling's proposal is accepted."
155,they may stay on to act as a mentor after that.
156,the mentors accompany the podling through all phases that lead to graduation as a top-level project.
157,the starting point is usually to find a champion.
158,"for that you might write to the general@incubator.a.o list with a brief description of your project, with relevant links, mentioning that you are looking for a champion and trying to get people interested."
159,"or, if you know any asf members or incubation mentors, ask them directly if they would be willing to help."
160,the champion helps the podling prepare an incubation proposal that describes the incoming project for the initial discussions with the incubator pmc.
161,"once the proposal is ready, the podling representatives send it to the general@incubator.a.o list for discussion, with a subject line like [discuss] foo proposal to raise the incubator pmc's attention."
162,"once the discussion phase is finished, the champion or a podling representative starts a [vote] thread on the general@incubator.a.o list."
163,the vote happens according to the asf voting rules .
164,"in short, it takes place on the incubator email list, lasts at least 72 hours, and is a majority vote by the incubator pmc members, with others being welcome to cast votes."
165,"once the incubator pmc votes to establish the podling, its infrastructure can be set up. usually, the champion or incubation mentors drive this process."
166,"however, it can also be driven by podling community members if they know how to proceed."
167,project can not issue press releases or other public statements about joining the asf before the incubator pmc accepts the podling.
168,there are also some restrictions about how podlings can advertise themselves and especially around press releases related to podlings.
169,"a specific process exists do donate code to the asf, which podlings also need to follow, based on software grants and/or cclas ."
170,"during incubation, the podling is expected to build and expand its community, which includes voting in new committers and ppmc members."
171,discussions of candidates and votes happen on the podling's private ppmc mailing list.
172,"during incubation, we expect a podling to make several software releases that gradually progress towards being fully conformant to the asf release policy ."
173,producing fully-conformant releases is a condition for graduation.
174,"podling releases must also include the word ""incubating"" in any release file names and include a disclaimer or disclaimer-wip as per the incubator releases guide , to prevent any confusion as to the project’s status."
175,voting on podling releases happens in two phases:
176,"first, the podling votes on the release on their dev mailing list."
177,"the vote is successful if there are at least three +1 votes from ppmc members, and more +1 than -1 votes from ppmc members."
178,"then, if that first vote is successful, the incubator pmc holds a vote on the incubator general mailing list."
179,"this is required to make the vote an act of the foundation, as for all asf releases."
180,"report votes from the podling dev list to the incubator pmc vote in the incubator pmc [vote] message, by explicitly mentioning the podling vote result and including a lists.apache.org link to the podling vote tally. this allows votes from mentors and other incubator pmc members to be binding in the incubator pmc vote, without people having to vote twice."
181,"both the podling and incubator votes follow the standard asf voting principles : they are majority votes that last at least 72 hours, and if people vote several times only their last vote counts."
182,"once the podling community starts feeling ready to graduate, they should make a self-assessment of that readiness."
183,the maturity model maintained by the asf's community development pmc is a good canvas for that and can help discover things that might have been overlooked during incubation.
184,"once the community and its incubation mentors feel that the podling is ready to graduate, based on their readiness self-assessment, a mentor or a member of the ppmc starts a [discuss] thread on the incubator general email list, proposing graduation and asking the incubator pmc to review the podling."
185,"if the people or organizations that donated the podling code to the asf own trademarks that the podling needs, they must transfer the trademarks to the asf before the podling can graduate."
186,"once the discussion dies down on the graduation proposal, a mentor or a member of the ppmc starts a [vote] thread on the incubator general mailing list, in which incubator pmc members cast their votes whether to recommend graduation to the asf's board of directors."
187,this vote follows the standard asf voting principles .
188,"it's a majority vote that lasts at least 72 hours, and if people vote several times only their last vote counts."
189,"once the incubator pmc votes to graduate a podling, the ipmc sends the board resolution that was created for the vote to the asf's board of directors."
190,"the board vote is effective immediately, although the public minutes of the board meeting appear later, usually within a month."
191,"once graduated, the podling needs to reflect its new status on the incubator status pages and make a few changes to its resources and processes."
192,"add the podling to the podling summary file in the ""incubator"" svn at content/podlings.xml (e.g. copy the entry from another podling that also has status=""current"") and see instructions ."
193,a mentor needs to create the web page that will track the project's status.
194,a mentor will also need to update it until others in the project's ppmc can update it .
195,the status page is the incubator's record of the progress made.
196,it must be kept update to date during incubation.
197,as the startup process continues and resources are created the status should be updated.
198,the template contains lists of actions which may be needed to start up a podling. all those which do not apply should be deleted.
199,the status page is a useful aid to workflow. volunteers can use it to sign up to the various tasks and monitor their progress.
200,once the mailing lists are set up and prospective committers subscribe then these may be used for discussion.
201,"resources should be requested in a particular order, and based on paperwork processed. do not request source repositories before sgas are filed, for instance, if the source code is not already apache licensed or category a licensed."
202,the proposal should include a list of required resources. all of these will require active set up.
203,"some are created by infrastructure after an appropriate request, others can be set up by any ipmc members (typically mentors)."
204,"infra has a guide that you can use to understand the flow of resource requests, and should be used to guide you in requesting resources."
205,the first resources to be created are ldap and dns. these should be requested from infra via apache infra jira → create task
206,"once these items are requested, mailing lists should be created next."
207,apache mailing lists require volunteer moderators.
208,new moderators can be changed later but at least one volunteer is required before the mailing lists can be set up.
209,moderation is a reasonably easy task though moderators may want to set up spam filtering .
210,having at least three moderators is recommended to spread the load.
211,the proposal should contain the rest of the information that needs to be collected before the mailing lists can be requested.
212,incubator is the responsible top level project. so the domain must be incubator.apache.org .
213,a podling that is already established and using an existing user interaction channel may want to keep those resources around until they feel they have transitioned to the asf successfully.
214,you will want to discuss this on your existing development lists.
215,mailing lists creation is a task for the infrastructure team .
216,prospective committers and mentors will need to subscribe. email them once the status file has been updated. inform any existing mailing lists or forums previously used by the project.
217,"once the commits list is created, the project must review the /incubator/${podling} tree, since any commits made prior to the list's creation will have generated no email trail."
218,apache uses ezmlm .
219,independent mailing lists and groups are perfectly acceptable but development should happen on the official mailing lists at apache.
220,"if a project has existing mailing lists, forums or groups the community needs to consider their future and plan for the transition to the official apache mailing lists."
221,it may be useful to move development first to the official lists followed gradually by the user resources.
222,"note that subscribers of external mailing lists will not be automatically subscribed to the new incubator project mailing lists. instead, a note should be posted to the old external mailing list asking them to subscribe to the new list."
223,mentors must be on the ipmc.
224,this should be checked prior to beginning incubation.
225,any prospective mentors who are not yet on the ipmc should ask to be added (by election).
226,email the application to private@incubator.apache.org .
227,prospective committers need to submit a contributor license agreement ( cla ).
228,"as graduation approaches, this original preference should be reviewed based on where the project is now."
229,graduation as a subproject is only possible if the subproject still falls within the scope of the project and requires the consent of the project pmc .
230,graduation as a project requires the formation of the new project by the board.
231,"the ipmc will also express a democratic opinion. for those seeking to graduate to a subproject this vote is to approve the transfer. for those seeking to graduation as a top level project, this will be a recommendation to the board."
232,"before you start thinking about graduation, you need to make sure you are ready and meet the requirements imposed on apache projects."
233,"before you are able to graduate, all tasks need to be completed."
234,the incubator pmc will check this file when they vote on the graduation of your project.
235,"once all tasks are done and the listed criteria met, your project may be ready for graduation."
236,"the ""process for ensuring suitable project and product names"" is mandatory for every podling which wants to graduate."
237,projects need to cut releases. apache projects need to understand how to cut apache releases.
238,"if you are going to cut a release (which is highly recommended), then please read the incubator release management guide for hints, tips and guidelines for cutting a release that will get approved by the ipmc without problems."
239,a major criterion for graduation is to have developed an open and diverse meritocratic community.
240,the openness of the community is not only measured by the number of contributors. open and respectful discussions on the mailing lists are vital.
241,ways to resolve technical conflict without destroying personal relationships must be learned.
242,learning to use mailing lists effectively is very important.
243,the project is considered to have a diverse community when it is not highly dependent on any single contributor (there are at least 3 legally independent committers and there is no single company or entity that is vital to the success of the project).
244,you can mitigate this requirement by admitting more external contributors to your project that have no tie to the single entity.
245,podlings who are unsure if they are ready to graduate may want to consider completing the apache project maturity model .
246,graduating to a top level project top level projects are created by the board .
247,the incubator project management committee (ipmc) can therefore only recommend to the board that the project is ready to graduate to a top level project.
248,graduation to a top level project requires:
249,a charter for your project
250,a positive community graduation vote
251,a positive ipmc recommendation vote
252,the acceptance of the resolution by the board
253,a community needs to be willing to govern itself before it can become a top level project.
254,a good way to demonstrate this is through a free vote (by the community) on the graduation proposal. this vote is not a requirement but is recommended.
255,it is unlikely that ipmc members will vote to approve graduation unless the mentors and community positively express their readiness for graduation.
256,"so, in this case a suitable board resolution should be drawn up by the community advised by the mentors ."
257,committers can access the podling template for resolutions in the committers svn repository .
258,your whimsy roster also includes a feature to draft a resolution.
259,the original proposal and the status document should be consulted when creating this document.
260,the board resolution is the ultimate definition of the scope of an apache project.
261,if you read these resolutions you also see that you need to appoint a chair for your project. it is up to the ppmc to choose one person to act as the chair after graduation.
262,the resolution should be proposed on the general incubator list before a vote is started to allow feedback.
263,"once a consensus has been reached, a vote should be started on the same general incubator list by a member of the ppmc proposing that the ipmc recommends the resolution to the board ."
264,top level projects are created by a resolution by the board .
265,"once the resolution has been finalized and consensus reached, it should be submitted to the board."
266,"for inclusion in the agenda for the next meeting, the resolution should be submitted at least 72 hours before that meeting."
267,"once there is clear consensus that the recommendation will happen, a member of the ppmc should contact asf marketing publicity at press(at)apache(dot)org if your project is interested in a formal press release announcing your graduation."
268,this should be done roughly at the same time that the board resolution is sent.
269,subprojects are accepted by a project management committee.
270,the incubator project management committee needs to approve the graduation of the podling to a subproject.
271,"becoming a subproject is a voluntary process, and should be accepted by the community becoming a sub-project."
272,"it should be clear to the ppmc and committers for the podling what the make up of the new sub-project should be, e.g. who belongs on the receiving pmc, who will be a committer."
273,this vote should happen on a public dev list.
274,a formal vote by the project pmc to accept the podling as a subproject is a prerequisite.
275,"once the accepting tlp have voted to accept the podling and the podling has voted to become a subproject, noticed should be sent to the ipmc via general at incubator.a.o email list indicating that the podling will become a subproject."
276,"if after 72 hours no issues are raised, the podling may be considered a subproject of the accepting tlp."
277,"likewise, if any ipmc member raises an issue, that should be discussed."
278,"if the issue is addressed, the member raising the issue should indicate they rescind their concerns or otherwise consider them resolved."
279,"in the vast majority of cases, a podling decides to retire on its own and that decision is later formally ratified by the incubator pmc; very rarely, the ipmc may act unilaterally."
280,"before the ipmc gets involved, a public discussion and community vote should be held on the podling's dev list. this ensures that all podling stakeholders are properly informed and have the opportunity to participate in the decision."
281,the final decision to retire the podling takes the form of a vote by the ipmc on general@incubator. the vote should be by lazy consensus.
282,"once the ipmc vote to retire the podling has closed, a mentor or other volunteer needs to perform the following steps."
283,update content/podlings.xml :
284,"update podling status to ""retired""."
285,"add an ""enddate"" attribute set to the date that the ipmc vote concluded."
286,"remove the ""reporting"" element."
287,"add the ""resolution"" element."
288,"update the podling's status page with a prominent message indicating when the podling retired: p span class=""retired"" the ${podling} podling retired on xxxx-xx-xx /span /p ."
289,has the copyright checkbox of the podling's incubation status page been checked off?
290,"if not, try to resolve it. if it cannot be resolved, the podling's source code must be removed from version control."
291,"it may be that the podling is moving or returning development elsewhere. if so, then modify the resolution attributes appropriately."
292,"delete the podling's dist dir, so that its releases will no longer be mirrored: svn remove https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/${podling}"
293,create a file retired.txt at the top-level of each podling source repository.
294,add entries to asf-mailer.conf and send mail to cvs at incubator.apache.org
295,remove entries from asf-authorization - this makes the directory rw to the incubator pmc.
296,"after infra modifies the website svn permissions, disable the podling website by installing an .htaccess like this"
297,file at the root of the podling website dir which consists of only a redirect to the podling status page.
298,"- when all steps towards retirement are done, announce completeness on general@incubator."
299,- indicate that the podling is closed down in the next board report.
300,the user accounts of the projects committers do not need to be removed.
301,a podling community should begin to familiarize themselves with the asf policies for releases.
302,"releases are always produced by an apache pmc, and for podlings, this pmc is the ipmc. this is why it is mandatory to have at least 3 +1 votes from ipmc members."
303,"usually, your mentors (who are also ipmc members) will vote on your releases, but if needed, other ipmc members will as well."
304,ipmc members will check for compliance with the asf policies and with incubator policies.
305,anybody reviewing your releases will explain what they checked and what they found. they will also rate the severity of any issues. some issues may be blockers. others issues may be resolved in later releases. those voting on the release will base their votes on this information.
306,"we want to welcome projects with active communities. to smooth this process, projects may need to make a few non-asf releases after incubation begins."
307,"a non-asf release may or may not be staged on asf infrastructure for a vote, but it is distributed via non-asf infrastructure, and is either not linked from a podling's website, or is linked but clearly marked as a non-asf release."
308,podlings can use non-asf releases as an opportunity to find asf policy violations and begin resolving them.
309,"podlings can request feedback by starting a ""[discuss]"" thread on general@incubator.apache.org. podlings can decide whether they prefer a ""[discuss]"" thread or a ""[vote]"" thread."
310,discussion should give podlings feedback on what they would need to do to bring their release in line with the requirements of an official asf release.
311,podlings will be responsible for capturing feedback in work items for their project.
312,feedback provided in a discussion thread will not block a non-asf release.
313,but the asf will not take on legal liability for these releases.
314,a podling will need to successfully make several asf releases before it can graduate from the incubator.
315,asking for feedback for non-asf releases is not obligatory. it is one of the services that the apache incubator offers our podling communities.
316,the incubator policies applys two additional constraints to podlings for their releases.
317,- release artifacts must include incubating in the final file name
318,- release artifacts must include one of two disclaimers
319,"for a podling to receive full permission from the ipmc to execute the release, the release vote must be held on the incubator general list and pass based on the standard package release voting rules."
320,"only incubator pmc votes are binding, but everyone is encouraged to vote."
321,the incubator pmc expects the source releases to be staged on https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/$podlingname so that they can easily be moved to the release location via svn mv.
322,"when making a release, a podling has a choice of using one of two disclaimers, the standard disclaimer or the work in progress disclaimer."
323,"if it is your first release, it is recommended that you use the work in progress disclaimer. this disclaimer allows you to list any non-compliance with asf policy and ipmc members are still be able to give your release a +1 vote."
324,"any releases using the work in progress disclaimer must still be legal and follow the terms of any 3rd party licenses, even if they are not compatible with the apache license."
325,"by the time you graduate all issues listed in the disclaimer need to have been corrected, and you must use the standard disclaimer text."
326,"if a podling chooses uses the standards disclaimer, then the release must comply with all asf policies."
